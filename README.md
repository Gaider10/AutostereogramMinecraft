Minecraft mod that renders the world as an [autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram).

### Requirements
- [Fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

### How to use
- Assign all keybindings from this mod in controls
- Open the config screen and fill out the parameters in the main category
- Use the toggle keybinding to enable/disable autostereogram view
- Use view distance keybindings to change autostereogram view distance

Since depth resolution in autostereograms is limited, to see close objects at higher depth resolution you will need to decrease autostereogram view distance.
